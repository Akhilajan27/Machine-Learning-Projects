# Land Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the price/value of land based on land area, distance to key
infrastructure, and location-related features using a machine learning model.

## 📌 Project Objective
To build a machine learning model that can accurately predict land prices by
analyzing geographical, infrastructural, and location-based factors.

This project helps in understanding how real estate prices vary with respect
to location, accessibility, and land type.
